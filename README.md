Vehicle Car Dekho Analysis
Welcome to the Vehicle Car Dekho Analysis project! In this project, we explore and analyze the Car Dekho dataset to gain insights into used car listings. The dataset provides information about various features of the cars, such as their model, year of manufacture, mileage, and more.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze the Car Dekho dataset and derive meaningful insights into the factors influencing the selling price of used cars. Potential analysis areas include:
* Understanding the distribution of selling prices across different car models.
* Analyzing the impact of various features such as fuel type and transmission on selling prices.
* Predicting the selling price of used cars based on the provided features.

  
## Dataset Overview
The Vehicle Car Dekho dataset consists of the following key columns:

| **Variable Name** | **Description** |
|--|--|
|name|name of the car|
|year|year in which car was bought|
|selling_price|selling price of the car|
|km_driven|number of kilometers the car is driven|
|fuel|fuel type of the car|
|seller_type|tells if car is sold by individual or dealer|
|transmission|Gear transmission of the car (Automatic/Manual)|
|owner|number of previous owners|
|mileage|mileage of the car|
|engine|engine capacity of the car|
|max_power|max power of engine|
|torque|torque of the car|
|seats|number of seats in the car|
  
## Analysis Steps
### Data Cleaning:
* Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
* Cleaned and standardized data types.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Explored the distribution of key features.
* Created visualizations to highlight trends and patterns.
### Price Prediction Model:
* Developed a predictive model for the selling prices of used cars.
* Explored the impact of different features on selling prices.
